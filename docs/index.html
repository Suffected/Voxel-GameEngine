                            <img class="mini-img" src="assets/imgs/VoxelGameEngine_FullText.png">, I was talking to my self around 4:00 AM and i said why to not try to make a voxels game engine? I'm actually a big fan of minecraft and the games who is sandbox & voxels.

                            Imagine having a game engine that is for voxel/sandbox only (Could change in the future).

                        <h2>
                            The thing that 90% of programmers/coders will say it's right, That there isn't a game engine called the best.
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            Alot of people uses different game engines and these people will say *The game engine that i'm using is the best game engine ever* but it's not like this, For now (4/17/2022) the best game engine for graphics is UE5. But sometimes you want a different thing to try it, I was like these people who wanted different thing to try, So i'm trying to do my own game engine and it will be for free! with GPL v3.0 License, A game engine for voxels and you don't need to program everthing to get the idea that's in your brain, You know when you think out the box there's alot of ideas that you get.
